# EasyGreen

## Description
Being stuck home made me realized that I wasn't the most environmentally friendly person. 

Knowing that I may not be the only one disregarding the environment, I decided to leverage technology to help others be more sustainable. The issues that I address is food waste. 

40% of the food in the U.S. today goes uneaten which is equivalent of $165 billion dollars worth of food each year. Food that decay in landfills can produce methane which is a potent greenhouse gas. And the list of problems goes on....

EasyGreen is a intuitive way for people to manage their food and waste by having a digital inventory of food items in their household and provide an array of tools to be eco-friendly:

* Find creative recipes given the food items you currently have in your home
* A nice visual graph of your inventory
* Create a shopping list 
* A Facebook Group feed within the app that allow other users to share their meals or give away free food - 10 second videos
* Set reminders when an item is about to expire
